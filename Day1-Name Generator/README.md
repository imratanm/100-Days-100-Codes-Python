# Hello There,
This is my first project from the 100 Days, 100 Codes – Python Challenge! 🎯
In this program, you simply enter your birthplace and your pet’s name to generate a fun and unique band name.

This code focuses on:

- Taking user input.
- String concatenation.
- Displaying the combined result.

Hope you like it! 🎸🔥
