# Coffee Machine ☕

This project simulates the behavior of a real-life coffee machine using Python.

The program is designed to demonstrate core Python concepts, with a primary focus on:

- Functions for modular and reusable code
- Dictionaries for managing resources, menu items, and prices

It provides a simple, interactive way to understand how a coffee machine operates while strengthening fundamental programming skills.
